                            Welcome to <B>mirror</B> (a.k.a. "we" or "us" or the "Company"). We value our visitors' privacy. This privacy policy summarizes what information we might collect from a registered user or other visitor ("you"), and what we will and will not do with it.
                            
                            Please note that this privacy policy does not govern the collection and use of information by companies that <B>mirror</B> does not control, nor by individuals not employed or managed by <B>mirror</B>. If you visit a Web site that we mention or link to, be sure to review its privacy policy before providing the site with information.

                            <H3>2. What we do with your personally identifiable information</H3>
                            It is always up to you whether to disclose personally identifiable information to us, although if you elect not to do so, we reserve the right not to register you as a user or provide you with any products or services. <I>Personally identifiable information</I> means information that can be used to identify you as an individual, such as, for example:
                            <P>
                            <UL>

                            <LI>any account-preference information you provide us

                            <LI>your computer's domain name and IP address, indicating where your computer is located on the Internet, and possibly your geographic location
                            <LI>session data for your login session, so that our computer can communicate with yours while you are logged in

                            If you do provide personally identifiable information to us, either directly or through a reseller or other business partner, we will:

                            <UL>
                            <LI>not sell or rent it to a third party without your permission - although unless you opt out (see below), we may use your contact information to provide you with information we believe you need to know or may find useful, such as (for example) news about our services and products and modifications to the Terms of Service;
                            <LI>take commercially reasonable precautions to protect the information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction;

                            We may collect other information that cannot be readily used to identify you, such as (for example) the domain name and IP address of your computer. We may use this information, individually or in the aggregate, for technical administration of our Web site(s); research and development; customer- and account administration; and to help us focus our marketing efforts more precisely.  The <B>mirror</B> service collects information about your Amazon AWS instances.

                            <UL>

                            <LI>to take customary precautions to guard against <I>malware</I> (viruses, Trojan horses, bots, etc.), for example by installing and updating suitable anti-virus software.
                            <LI>to notify us immediately at support@maclawran.ca if you believe your account has been comprimised.

                            <P>
                            <B>mirror</B> operations are located primarily in the United States. If you provide information to us, the information will be transferred out of your country to the United States.  In addition, since the <B>mirror</B> service polls your AWS account periodically on your behalf, any information resulting from such polling is also likely to be transferred to the United States.  In using the service and providing personal information to us, you are consenting to its storage and use as described herein.
                            <P>
                            <P>
                            <H3>8. Information collected from children</H3>
                            You must be at least 13 years old (and really smart) to use <B>mirror</B> Web site(s) and service(s). <B>mirror</B> does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. (See the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.)
